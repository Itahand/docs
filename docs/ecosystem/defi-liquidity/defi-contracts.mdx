Flow is a Layer 1 blockchain that supports EVM equivalency, offering two environments Flow EVM and Flow Cadence. Fungible and non-fungible tokens can seamlessly transfer between these environments via the native VM token bridge. As a result, many tokens have both a Flow EVM mainnet contract address and a Flow Cadence mainnet contract address, allowing developers to choose their preferred environment.

Below is a list of commonly used DeFi contracts on Flow:

## Flow EVM

<DeFiContractsTable environment="evm" />

## Flow Cadence

<DeFiContractsTable environment="cadence" />
